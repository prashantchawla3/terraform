This activity is to convert Below are the ARM template resource block properties, site config, app settings and connection strings for the website "". Convert the ARM template into Terraform and update the provided Terraform Code module block with respective  site config, app settings and connection strings in terraform format only. The App Service TErraform Module is a dynamic block so I can add any settings in the  site config, app settings and connection strings section, but I cannot add new variables into terraform. Give an output with the completed terraform module block that considers all that ARM template is providing.
