This activity is to convert Azure App Service Webapp ARM template block for the properties,  site config, app settings and connection strings sections  to be converted to terraform block with  site config, app settings and connection strings. Below are the ARM template resource block properties, site config, app settings and connection strings for the website "App Name". Convert the ARM template into Terraform and update the provided Terraform Code module block with respective  site config, app settings and connection strings in terraform format only. Do not remove existing settings that should be left to default rather only add or update the settings that are provided in the ARM template into the Terraform.  The App Service Terraform Module is a dynamic block so I can add any settings in the  site config, app settings and connection strings section, but I need all the variables that need to be added, add new variables into terraform. Give an output with the completed terraform module block that considers all that ARM template is providing.also extract a variables.tf file
